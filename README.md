# 2nd RESTART Tech Camp on 5G and Open RAN | September 9-12, Milan (Italy)

This is the repository for the O-RAN assignment/hands-on related to the tech camp.

You will learn to work with cellular datasets and train AI solutions to classify traffic profiles.

- The script `./Train_Predict_Light.py` offers a baseline training pipeline that shows you how to open the dataset, extract/plot data, and provide a skeleton to train a base AI algorithm.
- The script `./Test_Performance_Fake.py` offers a testing algorithm for your trained algorithm to verify that your solution processes data correctly and can be evaluated.

The datasets you need to download are located at:
- Fake testing dataset available at `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gjTM2qki8dSf0_02xxxQjIn7Qk2zaHH0/view?usp=sharing`. This has the same format as the testing dataset but has not the same data you will be evaluated against :)
- Training dataset available at ``

**Important:** 
- We will ask you to submit a trained model we can test using the `./Test_Performance_Fake.py` script. If you cannot test your model using that script, it means that you need to change input/output format to match the requirement.
- Groups that are willing to present their approach, are free to prepare 2-3 slides to present their work and results to the audience. Please let us know in advance if you are willing to present.
